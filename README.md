# OpenCV Python Basics to Advance
This repository is for my OpenCV &amp; computer vision learnings. From Basic to advance, all programs are in notebooks with documentation. Programs will upload as I complete documentation for my codes.

I am also writing tutorial series in simple English on OpenCV python where I am explaining all functions and parameters which we use in the OpenCV methods.
